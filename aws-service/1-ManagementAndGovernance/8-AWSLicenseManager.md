# Overview
+ AWS License Manager is a service that makes it easier for you to **manage your software licenses** from software vendors centrally across AWS and your on-premises environments. 
+ This provides **control and visibility** into the usage of your licenses, enabling you to **limit licensing overages and reduce the risk of non-compliance and misreporting**.
+ With **rule-based controls** on the consumption of licenses, administrators can **set hard or soft limits on new and existing cloud deployments**. Based on these limits, License Manager helps **stop non-compliant server usage** before it happens.
+ License Manager supports tracking any software that is licensed based on virtual cores (vCPUs), physical cores, sockets, or number of machines.
+ With License Manager, a license administrator can **distribute, activate, and track software licenses across accounts and throughout an organization**.
+ You can create licenses in AWS License Manager and **distribute them to end users using an IAM identity or through digitally signed tokens** generated by AWS License Manager.
+ If you are responsible for managing licenses in your organization, you can use License Manager to set up licensing rules, attach them to your launches, and keep track of usage. The users in your organization can then add and remove license-consuming resources without additional work.
# Managed Entitlements
+ With License Manager, a license administrator can distribute, activate, and track software licenses across accounts and throughout an organization.

    + **Product offers** – Oﬀers deﬁne the terms that subscribers are agreeing to when they subscribe to a product. To make a product available on AWS Data Exchange, providers must define a public offer. This offer includes prices and durations, data subscription agreement, refund policy, and the option to create custom offers
    + **Data sets** – A product can contain one or more data sets. A data set in AWS Data Exchange is a dynamic set of data which is versioned through the use of revisions.

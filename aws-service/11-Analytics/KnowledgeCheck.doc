Which services can a data analyst use to analyze the data in a data lake? (Select TWO.)
AWS DataSync
Amazon AppFlow
AWS Glue
Amazon Redshift
Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth
AWS Glue can be used as an extract-transform-load (ETL) service with a data lake. Amazon Redshift is used as a data warehouse that can integrate with your data lake on Amazon S3, extending your analytics capabilities to petabytes of data.

What are the key challenges in building a data lake? (Select THREE.)
Data governance
Machine learning model selection
Game servers
Data quality
Security
Hypervisor
Data governance: Managing and governing huge volumes of disparate data from multiple sources is difficult. Establishing policies, access controls, data lineage tracking, and metadata management is critical but challenging.

Data quality: Ingesting raw data from multiple sources leads to issues with data quality, inconsistencies, duplications, and integrity. Performing extract-transform-load (ETL) and cleaning for huge data volumes is hard.
Security: Securing a data lake with large amounts of heterogeneous data is challenging. Implementing access controls, encryption, masking, and auditing at scale needs thoughtful planning.
Thus, data governance, data quality, and security are the main challenges in building a data lake.

Which services solve the governance challenges for a data lake on AWS? (Select TWO.)
Amazon DataZone
AWS CloudTrail
AWS Lambda
AWS Lake Formation
Amazon Kinesis
The following services help to govern a data lake on AWS:
Amazon DataZone is a service that helps organizations manage, govern, and share data assets across AWS, on-premises sources, and third-party sources.
AWS Lake Formation is a managed service that simplifies building, securing, and managing data lakes.

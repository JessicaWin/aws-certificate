What are the advantages of using an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket as a data repository for your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system? (Select Three.)
Workload processing can begin before copying all of your data set into your FSx for Lustre file system.(lazy load)
Using linked Amazon S3 data repositories lowers your latency when using your FSx for Lustre file system.
Workloads using Spot Instances can resume processing after being stopped using a saved durable storage data set.
Using Amazon S3 reduces your per gigabyte month costs when using an FSx for Lustre persistent file system.
Amazon S3 provides durable storage for results data.
Your data can be backed up incrementally using the FSx for Lustre backup option.(s3 repository not support backup)
Using an Amazon S3 bucket does not reduce the direct costs of using FSx for Lustre. Once loaded into FSx for Lustre, the imported data set can be updated with changed and new data. Only persistent file systems that are not linked to an Amazon S3 bucket can be backed up using the FSx for Lustre backup option and backup is not applicable for a file system linked to Amazon S3. Using Amazon S3 does not reduce latency for the FSx for Lustre file system access; it does improve the initial load time using lazy loads and enables workload processing to begin sooner with large data sets. It also enables you to store your intermediate data set and results data to durable storage.

The primary resource type in Amazon FSx, analogous to an on-premises cluster
An isolated virtual ONTAP server
A data container for files, directories, and LUNs
A  firewall controlling inbound and outbound traffic to your file system

A file system is the primary resource type in Amazon FSx, analogous to an on-premises cluster.  An SVM is an isolated virtual ONTAP server. An FSx for ONTAP volume is a data container for files, directories, and logical unit numbers (LUNs).

Correct!  Depending on the throughput level you select, your ONTAP servers can provide up to 128 GB of in-memory cache and 2,400 GB of NVME cache.
Your Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP data is encrypted at rest and in transit by default. Is this statement true or false?
True
False

FSx for ONTAP data at rest is encrypted by default.  In-transit encryption needs to be turned on on the SVM and supported by the connecting client.
An Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system is provisioned with 2,048 GiB of solid-state drive (SSD) capacity. It needs to be capable of delivering at least 6,000 total input/output operations per second (IOPS).

Stop managing storage
Configure additional options
Eliminate the need to rearchitect
Lower operating costs compared to capital costs
Create a more robust operating system
Simplify migration to AWS
Amazon FSx for OpenZFS is a managed service so the storage infrastructure, hardware, and software do not need to be managed. Because FSx for OpenZFS is the same operating system used on premises, there is no need to rearchitect the storage. This helps simplify migrating from OpenZFS on premises to FSx for OpenZFS in the AWS Cloud.

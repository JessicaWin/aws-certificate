The following steps are used to change the instance type of an EBS-backed instance when the new instance type is compatible with the original instance type. Which is the correct order of the steps? 
1- Install new drivers; 2 - Stop the instance; 3 - Select the new instance type; 4 - Start the instance from the Amazon EC2 console. 
1- Stop the instance; 2 - Select the new instance type; 3 - Install new drivers; 4 - Start the instance from the Amazon EC2 console. 
1- Stop the instance; 2 - Select the new instance type; 3 - Start the instance from the Amazon EC2 console; 4 - Install new drivers. 
1- Select the new instance type; 2 - Install new drivers; 3 - Stop the instance; 4 - Start the instance from the Amazon EC2 console. 
Incorrect
1. If the new instance type requires drivers that are not installed on the existing instance, you must connect to 
your instance and install drivers first (for example, when moving to an instance based on the AWS Nitro System).
2. Stop the instance from the Amazon EC2 console.
3. With the instance still selected, choose Actions, Instance settings, Change instance type, and select the new instance type. If the instance type you selected supports EBS optimization, select EBS optimized to enable EBS optimization.
4. Start the instance from the Amazon EC2 console.
What are the considerations for determining where to place your data? (Select THREE.)
Compliance
Currency types
Service availability
Hardware offerings
Proximity to users
Administrative proximity to the data center

1. Compliance with data governance and legal requirements: Depending on your company and location, you might need to run your data out of specific areas. 
2. Proximity: Selecting a Region that is close to the majority of your customers will reduce latency and allow faster content delivery. 
3. Available services within a Region: Sometimes the closest Region might not have all the features that you want to offer to customers. AWS is frequently innovating by creating new services and expanding on features within existing services. 
A security group is a firewall that sits on which component?
VPC
Network
Instance
Availability Zone
Elastic network interface

Security groups
 are another security feature of AWS. Unlike network ACLs that are attached to the subnet, security groups are attached to the elastic network interface of the AWS resources within the subnet. That means the security groups would be at the boundary of the Amazon EC2 instance instead of at the subnet boundary like a network access control list (network ACL).
Your organization is large and has many location-based IT departments. You do not want to share Secure Shell (SSH) key pairs with the various locations. 
Which connection option/s could you use?
Connect by SSH

Which option will allow you to administer your Amazon EC2 instances?
Connect by Secure Shell (SSH)
Amazon EC2 Instance Connect
AWS Systems Manager Session Manager
Connect by PuTTY
EC2 Instance Connect provides a secure way to connect to your Linux instances using SSH. You use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and principals to control SSH access to your instances. EC2 Instance Connect removes the need to share and manage SSH key pairs.
With AWS Systems Manager Session Manager, you can manage your Amazon EC2 instances through a browser-based shell or through the AWS CLI. 
Session Manager removes the need to open inbound ports, manage SSH keys, or use bastion hosts.

Which of the Amazon EC2 instance status checks require manual administrator intervention to resolve the issue?
System status checks
Instance status checks
Neither require manual intervention.
Both checks require manual intervention.

Instance status checks monitor the software and network configuration of your individual instance. Amazon EC2 checks the health of the instance by sending an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) request to the network interface (NIC). These checks detect problems that require your involvement to repair.
System status checks monitor the AWS systems on which your instance runs. These checks detect underlying problems with your instance that require AWS involvement to repair. When a system status check fails, you can choose to wait for AWS to fix the issue, or you can resolve it yourself.
Which Amazon EC2 metrics can you view in the instance dashboard on the Amazon EC2 console? (Select THREE.)
CPU utilization
RAM
Disk I/O
Network utilization
Memory used
Instance process ID
You can monitor CPU utilization, disk I/O, and network utilization for your EC2 instances. When performance falls outside of your established baseline, you might need to reconfigure or optimize the instance to reduce CPU utilization, improve disk I/O, or reduce network traffic.
What gathered data does AWS Trusted Advisor provide its recommendations from? (Select TWO.)

Which option can you perform by using AWS CLI to create a trail?
Create an all-Regions trail.
Create a single-Region trail.
Create both a single-Region and all-Regions trail.
You cannot create a trail from the AWS CLI.

You can only create a single-Region trail by using the AWS CLI.
What happens to your existing all-Regions trail if you add a new Region to your environment?
A new single Region trail must be created.
The new Region must be manually added to the existing trail.
The new Region is automatically added to the trail.
You must delete and recreate the all-Regions trail.

If a Region is added after you create a trail that applies to all Regions, that new Region is automatically included, and events in that Region are logged. Creating a trail in all Regions is a recommended best practice, so that you capture activity in all Regions in your account. Because of this, an all-Regions trail is the default option when you create a trail in the CloudTrail console. 
What is required to connect to the Amazon EC2 serial console using a remote SSH client?
It's a one-step process. 
Just change the SSH target to the syntax of  
INSTANCE_ID.port0@serial-console.ec2-instance-connect.us-east-1.aws
1 - Get the public key from the private key. 
2 - Push the SSH public key to the instance using the AWS CLI. 
3 - Use the private key  with the SSH client to connect using the syntax of  INSTANCE_ID.port0@serial-console.ec2-instance-connect.us-east-1.aws
1 - Get the public key from the private key. 
2 - Push the SSH private key to the instance using the AWS CLI. 
3 - Use the public key with the SSH client to connect using the syntax of  INSTANCE_ID.port0@serial-console.ec2-instance-connect.us-east-1.aws
You cannot use an SSH client to connect to the EC2 serial console. The browser-based EC2 serial console is the only way to make a serial connection to the EC2 instance.

Which of the following are scenarios where you might select Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose for data processing? (Select THREE.)
You want to ingest a very high volume of data and store it to Amazon Redshift.
You want to ingest a very high volume of data in a single stream that must be processed by three consumer applications.
You want to ingest a very high volume of data, transform its format, and store it to an Amazon Aurora database.
You must respond to individual messages as they are received.
You want to ingest a very high volume of data, transform its format, and store it to Amazon S3.
You want to simplify retry handling on streaming data, and the order of records in the stream is not critical.
Kinesis Data Firehose is ideal for ingesting data for storage. It can also transform data using an AWS Lambda function before storing it.
Kinesis Data Firehose streams can only be associated with a single consumer, and the target must be Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon OpenSearch Service, or Splunk.
Messaging services like Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) or Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) would be better suited for processing and responding to individual messages than processing a stream of data.
Kinesis Data Firehose has built-in retries. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams does not, but order is not guaranteed with Kinesis Data Firehose.
You are setting up an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as an event source to an AWS Lambda function that takes an average of 3 minutes to process each message. What are the most appropriate configuration options as a starting point? (Select THREE.)
Set the batch size to 4 or lower.
Set the batch size to 5 or higher.
Set the visibility timeout on the queue to 6x the batch size
Set the visibility timeout on the queue to 6x the function timeout.
Configure a dead-letter queue.
Configure the IteratorAge threshold.

Your batch size must allow all the messages in a batch to process within the Lambda timeout. That means (batch size * 3 minutes) < 15 minutes.
It is a best practice to set the visibility timeout on your SQS queue to 6x the Lambda function timeout to allow for retries if the function is getting throttled.
It is also a best practice to configure a dead-letter queue.
The IteratorAge metric is helpful for monitoring streaming data, but is not relevant for queues.
Which of these statements about AWS Step Functions States Language are true? (Select THREE.)t.
Task and Parallel states can have a field named Retry. An individual retrier represents a certain number of retries.
Choice states can have a field named Catch. When a state reports an error that can't be resolved by retriers, Step Functions scans through the catchers to find the error name in the ErrorEquals field.
You can't use a Retry or Catch field to handle timeouts.
The Amazon States Language defines a set of built-in strings that name well-known errors, all beginning with the States. prefix.
The reserved name States.ALL is a wildcard that matches any error name.
Choice states can have a field named Retry. An individual retrier represents a certain number of retries.
All of these items are true with the exception of Choice states being able to use the Catch field, You can use Retry or Catch fields to handle timeouts, and Choice states can not have a field named Catch. Task and Parallel states can have a Catch field.
Which of the following are true about Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) and AWS Lambda? (Select TWO.)
A best practice is to set the visibility timeout to 3 times the timeout you configure for your Lambda function.
If a Lambda function returns errors when processing messages, Lambda decreases the number of processes polling the queue.
Lambda has a default of five parallel processes to get things off of a queue.
If there is an increase in queue size, Lambda decreases the concurrency required to reduce cost.
Correctly unchecked
If the visibility timeout expires before the Lambda function processes the messages, messages will be deleted by the queue.
If a Lambda function returns errors when processing messages, Lambda decreases the number of processes polling the queue. In addition, Lambda has a default of five parallel processes to get things off of a queue.
A best practice is to set your visibility timeout to 6 times the function timeout, not 3 times. If the Lambda service detects an increase in queue size, it will automatically increase how many batches it gets from the queue, each time. That means it will increase the number of concurrent Lambda functions it invokes. Lastly, if the visibility timeout expires before the Lambda function has processed the messages in a batch, any message in that batch that hasn't been deleted by your function will become visible again.
To learn more about failure management with Lambda and Amazon SQS, review the Failure Management in Event-Driven Architectures lesson.
Which of these patterns for communicating status updates do you use to get status information on a long-running transaction?
WebSockets with AWS AppSync
Client polling pattern
Saga pattern with AWS Step Functions
Webhooks with Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)

Client polling is a common way to get status information on a long-running transaction. With the client polling, the client can use the ID returned from Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to get the status of the request. 
Which of the following are attributes of using streaming services for serverless data processing? (Select TWO.)
With streaming services, data is deleted when it has been consumed.
The data on the stream remains in the stream for a designated period of time and then is gone, regardless of consumer behavior.
Each stream consumer needs to maintain a pointer to a particular position in the stream. After consuming the message, the consumer moves the pointer forward to the next record and processes it.
With streaming services, you can configure retries up to a certain number of attempts, and dead-letter queues are built in to the service.
With streaming services, the core entity is an individual message.
The choice between streaming and messaging for serverless data processing depends on the nature of the data you are collecting and the type and timing of processing you need to do.

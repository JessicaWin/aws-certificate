What are the primary differences between an import to Amazon S3 job type and a local compute and storage only job type? (Select TWO.)
AWS DataSync can be used with only a local compute and storage only job type.
The number of vCPUs and the amount of memory are different.
Amazon EC2 instances are available only with a local compute and storage only job type.
Whether your NFS data is imported into your Amazon S3 when the device is returned.
The 8 TB HDD or 14 TB SSD storage space is formatted differently.
The same AWS Snowcone device is used for all job types. The device specifications and compute capabilities are the same. The 8 TB or 14 TB of available storage is formatted as NFS file storage with an import to Amazon S3 job type.

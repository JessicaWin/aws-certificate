# Overview
+ Device Farm is **an app testing service** that you can use to test and interact with your Android, iOS, and web apps on real, physical phones and tablets that are hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
+ There are two main ways to use Device Farm:
    + **Automated testing of apps** using a variety of testing frameworks.
    + **Remote access of devices** onto which you can load, run, and interact with apps in real time.

# Automated app testing
+ Device Farm allows you to upload your own tests or use built-in, script-free compatibility tests. Because testing is performed in parallel, tests on multiple devices begin in minutes.
+ As tests are completed, a test report that contains high-level results, low-level logs, pixel-to-pixel screenshots, and performance data is updated.
+ Device Farm supports testing of native and hybrid Android and iOS apps, including those created with PhoneGap, Titanium, Xamarin, Unity, and other frameworks. It supports remote access of Android and iOS apps for interactive testing

# Remote access interaction
+ Remote access allows you to swipe, gesture, and interact with a device through your web browser in real time. There are a number of situations where real-time interaction with a device is useful. For example, customer service representatives can guide customers through the use or setup of their device. 
+ During a remote access session, Device Farm collects details about actions that take place as you interact with the device. Logs with these details and a video capture of the session are produced at the end of the session.
